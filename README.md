**GDB-UI** is a modern, web-based user interface for the GNU Debugger (GDB) that enhances your debugging experience. By integrating GDB‚Äôs powerful capabilities with an intuitive design, GDB-UI simplifies the process of monitoring program execution, inspecting variables, and setting breakpoints. Perfect for developers working with C, C++, Ada, and more, our tool is designed to streamline your development workflow.

## üåü Overview

GDB-UI provides an accessible interface to the robust GNU Debugger. It empowers developers by offering real-time debugging, breakpoint management, and variable inspection through an elegant web-based platform. Whether you are developing complex systems or working on small projects, GDB-UI is built to improve productivity and debugging efficiency.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Modern Web Interface:** Sleek and user-friendly design for ease of use.
- **Full GDB Integration:** Access the complete functionality of GDB.
- **Real-Time Debugging:** Monitor and control program execution in real time.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Ideal for C, C++, Ada, and potentially other languages.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Customize and extend the tool with plugins and additional modules.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Frontend and backend test suites to ensure stability.
- **Docker and Manual Setup:** Multiple installation options to suit your environment.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** Version 18
- **Python:** Version 3.10
- **Docker & Docker Compose:** (Optional, for containerized setup)
- **Git:** For source control management

---

## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these instructions to quickly set up and begin using GDB-UI. Choose between the Docker-based or manual installation method based on your preference.

---

## üîß System Architecture

GDB-UI is built with a clear separation of concerns:
```
GDB-UI/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gdbui_server/  # Backend services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webapp/  # Frontend interface
```

- #### Backend (Python Server):
 Handles communication with GDB, processes debugging commands, and serves APIs.
- #### Frontend (React Client): 
Provides the user interface, visualizes debugging data, and interacts with the backend via REST APIs and WebSockets.

- The modular architecture ensures that both components can be developed, tested, and scaled independently.

---

## üìñ Installation

There are two primary methods to install GDB-UI: using Docker or setting up the components manually.

---

### Server Setup

#### Docker Setup

1. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.**
2. **Run the following command:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up
    ```

This command builds and starts both the frontend and backend services. The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

#### Manual Server Setup

1. **Navigate to the `gdbui_server` directory:**

    ```sh
    cd gdbui_server
    ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the backend server:**

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

---

### Client Setup

#### Manual Client Setup

1. **Navigate to the `webapp` directory:**

    ```sh
    cd webapp
    ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the client application:**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Run in Development Mode

For a streamlined development workflow:

1. **Server:** Ensure the Python backend is running in development mode.

2. **Client:** Run the React development server with hot-reloading enabled.

3. **Live Reload:** Any changes to the code will automatically update the running application, allowing for efficient iterative development.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Workflow

To maintain a high standard of code quality and collaboration, please adhere to the following development workflow guidelines.

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch:** Always reflects the production-ready state.

- **Feature Branches:** Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes.

- **Naming Convention:** Use clear, descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-breakpoint-ui` or `bugfix/fix-variable-display`).

---

## üîÑ Testing

- **Frontend:**
 Run tests using Vite. Navigate to the `webapp` directory and execute:

    ```sh
    cd webapp
    npm run test
    ```

- **Backend:** 
Execute backend tests by navigating to the `gdbui_server` directory and running:

    ```sh
    cd gdbui_server
    python -m unittest discover -s tests
    ```

#### Note: Ensure that all tests pass before merging any changes.

---

## üìà Production Deployment

For production deployment, follow these guidelines:

- **Docker:** Use Docker Compose to deploy a stable environment.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate with our CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

---

## üõ† Linting and Formatting

```
## for frontend
cd webapp
npm run lint           # for check lint
npm run lint:fix       # for fix lint
npm run format:check   # for check format
npm run format         # for fix formatting


## for backend
cd gdbui_server

make lint
make format

and if you want to do mannually 

ruff check --fix .     # for Run Ruff for Linting & Auto-Fixing
flake8 .               # to check the linting errors and warnig
ruff format .          # Format Code with Ruff
```
